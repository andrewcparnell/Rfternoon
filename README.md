## Rfternoon: advanced R in a few hours

Welcome to a very short R course that aims to teach you some of the amazing, advanced things you can do in R, in just a few hours.

To get started make sure you have downloaded [R](https://www.r-project.org) and [Rstudio](https://rstudio.com).

Then, open up Rstudio and in the Console window type:
`install.packages(c('ggplot2', 'plotly', 'mlr', 'randomForest', 'rstan', 'shiny', 'mlbench'))`

(If you have problems installing `rstan`, visited the [getting started guide](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started))

If all works well, you are now ready to start the course. Download all the files above by clicking Clone or download > Download Zip. Double click on the `Rfternoon.Rproj` file and you can now start coding!
